# COGNA Graphical Editor

## Currently not further developed, because of switch to the official Nengo neuro engineering framework.

## Description
This editor is supposed to allow an easier way of building and editing COGNA networks and architectures than scripting. The main advantage is a better overview due to the visualization of neural pathways while editing.

## File Format
The main file format is Json.
